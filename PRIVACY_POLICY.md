# Privacy Policy for No Corner Radius

**Last Updated: November 11, 2025**

## Overview

No Corner Radius ("the Extension") is a browser extension that removes rounded corners from webpages by modifying CSS styles locally in your browser.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any data whatsoever.**

The Extension:
- Does NOT collect any personal information
- Does NOT track your browsing history
- Does NOT store any data locally or remotely
- Does NOT transmit any information to any servers
- Does NOT use cookies or any tracking mechanisms
- Does NOT share any information with third parties

## How the Extension Works

The Extension operates entirely within your browser and:
- Applies CSS rules to remove border-radius styles from webpage elements
- Uses JavaScript to ensure rounded corners remain removed as pages dynamically update
- All modifications happen locally in your browser and are temporary (they disappear when you close or reload the page)

## Permissions

The Extension requires access to all websites (`<all_urls>`) solely to apply the corner radius removal functionality. This permission does not grant the Extension any ability to read, collect, or transmit your data.

## Third-Party Services

The Extension does not integrate with or use any third-party services, analytics, or tracking tools.

## No Warranty & Limitation of Liability

THE EXTENSION IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE EXTENSION OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE EXTENSION.

USE OF THIS EXTENSION IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. THE AUTHORS ASSUME NO LIABILITY FOR ANY ISSUES, DAMAGES, OR PROBLEMS THAT MAY ARISE FROM USING THIS EXTENSION.
